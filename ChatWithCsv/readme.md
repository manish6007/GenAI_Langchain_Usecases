# Chat with CSV using pandas agent

This Streamlit application allows users to upload a CSV file and ask questions about the data using the LangChain pandas agent. The application utilizes OpenAI for generating responses based on the provided CSV data.

## Web UI

## Features

- Upload a CSV file
- Display the uploaded CSV data
- Ask questions about the data
- Get responses generated by the LangChain pandas agent

## Requirements

- Docker
- Python 3.10+

## Setup

### Create and Run the Docker Image

1. **Create a `requirements.txt` file** with the following content:
    ```
    streamlit
    python-dotenv
    pandas
    langchain
    langchain_experimental
    langchain_openai
    ```

2. **Create a `Dockerfile`** with the following content:
    ```dockerfile
    # Use the official Python image from the Docker Hub
    FROM python:3.10-slim

    # Set the working directory in the container
    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy the requirements.txt file into the container at /app
    COPY requirements.txt .

    # Install the required libraries
    RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

    # Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
    COPY . .

    # Make port 8501 available to the world outside this container
    EXPOSE 8501

    # Define the command to run the app
    CMD ["streamlit", "run", "your_script.py"]
    ```

3. **Ensure your main script is named `app.py`** or adjust the Dockerfile to reflect the correct script name.

4. **Build the Docker image** using the following command:
    ```sh
    docker build -t chat-with-csv .
    ```

5. **Run the Docker container** using the following command:
    ```sh
    docker run -p 8083:8083 chat-with-csv
    ```

6. **Access the Streamlit app** in your web browser at `http://localhost:8083`.
