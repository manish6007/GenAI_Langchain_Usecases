**ChatGPT: GPT-4 App**

This is a conversational AI application built using OpenAI's GPT-4 and Streamlit. The app enables interactive chats with the language model using gradient-based techniques.

**Code Explanation**

The application imports Streamlit and OpenAI libraries. Streamlit is used for UI development and OpenAI library is used to interact with the OpenAI API.

```python
import streamlit as st
from openai import OpenAI
```

The application title is set to "ChatGPT: GPT-4".

```python
st.title("ChatGPT: GPT-4")
```

The OpenAI API key is set from Streamlit secrets.

```python
client = OpenAI(api_key=st.secrets["OPENAI_API_KEY"])
```

The default model used in this application is "gpt-4".

```python
if "openai_model" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state["openai_model"] = "gpt-4"
```

The chat history is initialized to save all the chat messages.

```python
if "messages" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.messages = []
```

All previous chat messages in the history are displayed.

```python
for message in st.session_state.messages:
    with st.chat_message(message["role"]):
        st.markdown(message["content"])
```

The application accepts user input and adds it to the chat history.

```python
if prompt := st.chat_input("What is up?"):
    # Add user message to chat history
    st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "user", "content": prompt})
    # Display user message in chat message container
    with st.chat_message("user"):
        st.markdown(prompt)
```

The user's input is processed by GPT-4 model and its response is displayed in chat and also added to chat history.

```python
with st.chat_message("assistant"):
    stream = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=st.session_state["openai_model"],
        messages=[
            {"role": m["role"], "content": m["content"]}
            for m in st.session_state.messages
        ],
        stream=True,
    )
response = st.write_stream(stream)
st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response})
```

**Installation & Usage**

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install Streamlit and OpenAI Python libraries using pip.

```
pip install streamlit openai
```

3. Get your API key from OpenAI and add it to Streamlit secrets.
4. Run the application using Streamlit.

```
streamlit run app.py
```

Enjoy interacting with the AI!

**Notes**

This interactive AI takes advantage of OpenAI's state-of-the-art model GPT-4 to provide autocompleted sentences based on historical sentences. Feel free to experiment within the platform and play around with the code to better fit your use-case.

Have fun and happy chatting!
